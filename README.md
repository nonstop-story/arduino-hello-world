Arduino Hello World
====================
This project is a typical hello world for Arduino, 
with no source but a framework where you can start with.

Because the official Arduino IDE is hard-to-use, I converted the project
structure to CMake-based which means this project can be opened in CLion.

## Requirements
You need to install 2 CLion plugins:
1. [Arduino Support](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9984-arduino)
2. [Serial Port Monitor](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/index?xmlId=SerialPortMonitor)

## Acknowledge

We would like to thank [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=mozart++) for sharing free
open-source licences of amazing tools such as [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/?from=mozart++).
